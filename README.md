# ProjectOOPS

The project consists of three classes:
-Project1Main
-Options
-Menu

Options class contains all the functionalities that we need to acheive through the project
Menu class controls all navigations and callings depending on the input provided by the user
Project1Main outputs the basic description of the program and is used for calling methods initially

Sprints:
Sprint 1: To design the methods for acheiving the required objectives
Sprint 2: To design the flow of execution depending on user's input

Flowchart:
Step 1- psvm()
Step 1- display() method to provide various options to user
Step 1- user input via input() method passed to process() method
Step 1- switch case selected in process() depending on user's input
Step 1- method gets executed depending on the case selected asking user for further input or displaying the requested output
Step 1- display() method running at the end of every switch case 
Step 1- a further user input if user wants to do any further task

Front end desinging can be used to make the user interaction more effective and easy to use
Absctraction can be used to hide the internal processings
